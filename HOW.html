   <h2>HOW TO GO GREEN?</h2>
    <p>Despite the huge surge in computing power demands, there are many existing technologies and methods by which significant savings can be made. This series is dedicated to the ways a typical organization can reduce their energy footprint while maintaining required levels of computing performance. 
        Below are certain approaches towards green computing:</p>
        <h3>Performance Tuning</h3>
        <p>Performance tuning is the process of adjusting a computer so that it will perform to the best of its ability, given its current or aggregate workload. By doing so you can squeeze out every drop of computing goodness that your current systems have, which is often a lot. This will reduce energy footprint by avoiding unnecessary hardware upgrades, cooling, and associated e-waste.
            Performance tuning and management can also
             lower the overall energy a given system uses
              because there are less resource allocated internally for a 
              given software process. Disk I/O, CPU, memory reduction can lead to measurable energy savings.</p>
              <h3>Capacity Planning</h3>
              <p>Capacity Planning allows an organization to grow in a coherent and organized way while minimizing the amount of hardware needed to perform all required computing. Resource utilization is measured over time and analyzed to determine the precise computing infrastructure requirements.
                Organized growth is important because it avoids having heterogeneous and ill-performing systems that drive up costs and excess energy need. It also avoids purchasing of overpowered or underpowered equipment that must be later disposed or would otherwise sit and suck power.
                Because the success of any IT operations center hinges on the performance requirements of its customers, it is vital to know what the current and future capacity needs are in advance so that designs will accurately reflect future needs. Server consolidation, virtualization, and performance all rely on
                 accurate forecasts of future needs which are provided by capacity plans and forecast models.</p>
                 <h3>
                    Virtualisation
                 </h3>
                 <p>
                    Instead of having one computer for each service or set of services, you can instead consolidate each server onto a larger virtualized system that uses its resources to the fullest, and has a much smaller energy footprint. It consists of virtualised servers, grid computing, data centre automation and provisioning, and virtual networking and telecommuting. 
                    This benefits the system in several ways:
                 </p>
                 <p> It reduces the total amount of hardware used in your environment</p>
                 <p>Idle Virtual servers can be powered off</p>
                 <p>The virtualized server will have much less idle time and waste less</p>
                 <p>The total volume of space, air, and rent will be reduced. Data centres can use up to 100 times the energy per square foot of typical office space.</p>
    <p>ome power companies pay rebates for conversion to virtualized systems.
        There is a strong connection between virtualization, capacity planning, and performance management because of the extreme performance requirements that are placed on virtual servers. Once in place, virtual systems have a unique power flexibility that allows for power consolidation, efficiency, and ability to power-off unused systems.</p>
<h3>Reliabilty Considerations</h3>
<p>Reliability of hardware is an important aspect of green computing because it reduces the overall costs of energy associated with system failures and E-waste. Performing coherent and routine reliability analysis of the IT infrastructure can identify unreliable systems and designs. In addition, companies benefit by realizing a more reliable IT and e-commerce framework. System failures cost significant amounts of energy expenditure due to human intervention in cooled environments, travel to and from data centers, and other related activities.
    E-waste, or scrapped computer hardware, is a very serious problem because of the energy required to dispose off the materials, and the hazardous chemicals embedded in the waste materials. Reliability is directly related to manufacturing, repair, and ROI costs of systems. Increasing the reliability of the IT infrastructure leads to significant energy savings while minimizing hazardous waste materials and their disposal.</p>
<h3>Cooling Conideration</h3>
<p>Cooling the tremendous amounts of heat generated by computers is essential in order to keep the equipment and the software stable. This cooling in turn requires a significant amount of energy which can be estimated at between 30% to 50% of the energy used to power the hardware. This means that for each 100 kilowatt-hours used to power a system, 50 kilowatt-hours could be required to cool it.
    Energy consumption can be reduced by concentrating on the initial source of the energy burned in the computer. Energy efficient fans, CPUs, power supplies, disks, and related components can make a big difference that pays huge dividends. Other ways to effect efficient cooling</p>
<p>1. System design and load matching</p>
<p>2. Use of efficient power equipment which exist today</p>
<p>3. Floor layout and vent layout design</p>
<p>4. Coupled cooling systems that directly cool and exhaust.
</p>
<h3>Maximise What You Have</h3>
<p>one of the first things that smart companies do when they run into performance problems with their IT is to optimize and tune their infrastructure. This can lead to tens of percentage points worth of extra performance. Optimizing IT systems is a very effective way to get better performance without initiating purchase and design expense. 
    Make sure you have a comprehensive plan that implements periodic performance tuning.</p>
